Matthew Petty, a Data Center Facilities Manager at Princeton University showed us all the high-performance machines. We learned about all the different types of machinery it takes to make up the data center. It was very impressive how they are able to keep all their equipment running efficiently.\nThere was also a presentation given by Ian Cosden who is the Director of Research Software Engineering for Computational & Data Science, and Sushma Mendu, the Director of Software and Application Services at Princeton University.  They both spoke to us as well, about the different uses for the high performance center as well as opportunities they have there.  They let us know about the skill sets needed to succeed in the future.\nThe whole trip was really enjoyable and everyone had a great time. We can't thank the people at the Princeton HPC Data Center enough for it."

Our CS Academy students led the way, teaching beginner coding on code.org to the enthusiastic 5th graders. The energy was electric, and we were blown away by the bright minds of these young learners. Here‚Äôs to inspiring the next generation of coders!"
